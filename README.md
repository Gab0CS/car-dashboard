Hello code reviewer!, In this Readme, I'll tell you more about the project.

This is a Next.js app, a framework I really like for building full-stack applications using React.

For icons, this app uses React Icons.
The charts are made with Chart.js
Log history table uses MaterialUI

Initially, I intended to use the data directly from the .csv file, but I encountered numerous errors and didn't have enough time to resolve all of them. Therefore, I used an online parser. Here's the link I used: 
https://csvjson.com/csv2json

To see the project in your own computer just clone the repository
cd to the local file of the repository

run : npm install and then npm run dev

And thats it, you should be seeing the project on your localhost:3000
